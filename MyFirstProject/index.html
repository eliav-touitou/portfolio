          <h3 id="tribute-info">The stock market crashes:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li> <strong>The Panic of 1907 - </strong> A group of investors borrowed money from banks to finance an effort to corner shares of United Copper Company. UCC went bust under the weight of speculation, and then other firms followed: Stocks lost 15% to 20% of their value. Public confidence in banks fell and depositors rushed to withdraw their money, causing ruinous runs. </li>
            </br>
            <li><strong>Wall Street Crash of 1929 -</strong>For nearly a decade, the stock market had kept rising in a speculative spiral. Overproduction in factories and a Roaring 20s giddiness led consumers to take on too much debt and believe financial instruments would climb perpetually higher. Finally, catching on to the overheated situation, seasoned investors began cashing out. Stock prices dropped first on the 24th, briefly rallied — and then went into free fall on October 28-29. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 25% in those days. Ultimately, the market lost 85% of its value.  </li>
            </br>
            <li><strong>"Black Monday" Crash of 1987 -</strong> Sinking oil prices and US-Iran tensions had turned the market pessimistic. But what led to the wipeout on October 19 — eerily close to the 58th anniversary of the 1929 crash — was the relatively new prevalence of computerized trading programs that allowed brokers to place bigger and faster orders. Unfortunately, they also made it difficult to stop trades soon enough once prices started to plummet. Ultimately, The Dow and S&P 500 each dropped more than 20% and Nasdaq lost 11%. International stock exchanges also tumbled.
      
         </li>
         </br>
            <li><strong>Dot-Com Bubble Burst of 2000 -</strong>In the 1990s, with the internet revolutionizing professional and personal life, stocks in companies with ".com" after their names surged. Twelve large-cap stocks rose more than 1,000%; one, chipmaker Qualcomm, saw its stock increase more than 2,500%. Investors gobbled up shares of tech IPOs but seemed unaware that not every company tied to the World Wide Web could sustain its growth — or even had a viable. "A new economy was being born and it was hard to place a value on it," Chandler says. But finally, people did — aided by some tighter money policies imposed by the Federal Reserve. They started to sell. By October 2002, the tech-heavy Nasdaq had fallen more than 75% from its March 2000 crescendo of 5,048.62.  </li>
         </br>
            <li><strong>Subprime Mortgage Crisis of 2007-08 -</strong> At the turn of the 21st century, real estate was hot. Hungry for commissions, lenders practically gave money to under qualified homebuyers. Investors bought up mortgage-backed securities and other new investments based on these "subprime" loans. Eventually, though, the inevitable happened: Burdened by debt, borrowers began to default, property prices fell, the investments based on them dived in value. Wall Street noticed, and in 2008 the stock market started to decline. By early September, it was down almost 20%. On Sept. 15, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped nearly 500 points.  </li>
         </br>
            <li><strong>The COVID-19 Crash of 2020 -</strong>By the beginning of 2020, COVID-19 had spread widely in China and then to Europe — notably Italy — and to the US, where restaurants and nonessential stores closed to stem the tide of infection.
      
      As investors realized the extent to which the coronavirus could spread and negatively affect the economy, the stock market began to quiver. On March 16, with mandatory lockdowns being announced,the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost nearly 13% and the S&P 500 dropped 12%.   </li>
